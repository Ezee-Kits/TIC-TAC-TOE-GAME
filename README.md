Tic Tac Toe Game in Python
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game! 🎮
This project demonstrates how to create the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the Python programming language. Whether you're a beginner or looking to practice your coding skills, this simple and interactive game is a great way to learn Python fundamentals while having fun!

🧠 Game Concept
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or an "O". The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

🚀 Features
Simple and easy-to-understand code: Perfect for beginners who are learning Python.
Two-player game: Play with a friend in a console-based interface.
User-friendly prompts: Enter your move using grid positions.
Detects win, draw, or invalid moves: Ensures smooth gameplay with clear results.

📚 What You'll Learn
Basic Python programming: Understand loops, functions, and conditionals.
Game logic: Learn how to handle game states and check for winning combinations.
Input validation: Ensures players make valid moves within the grid.
